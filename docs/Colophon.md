## Colophon

On the cover page is Agostino Ramelli’s bookwheel mechanism from 1588.
It could be seen as an early hypertext navigation aid. This image of the
engraving is hosted by J. E. Johnson of [New
Gottland](http://newgottland.com/2012/02/09/before-the-ereader-there-was-the-wheelreader/ramelli_bookwheel_1032px/).

The typefaces are Linux Libertine for body text and Linux Biolinum for
headings, both by Philipp H. Poll. Typewriter face is Inconsolata
created by Raph Levien and supplemented by Dimosthenis Kaponis and
Takashi Tanigawa in the form of Inconsolata LGC.

Graphic design and typography are done by Andres Raba. Texinfo source is
converted to HTML using a customized version of `texi2any` utility in
Texinfo 5.1 package. Diagrams are drawn with Inkscape and mathematics is
typeset with the help of MathJax and MathML.
